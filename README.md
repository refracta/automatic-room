## light-controller ([bathroom](bathroom-light-controller), [living room](living-room-light-controller))
A project to control lights via HTTP API using NodeMCU and a relay module.

## [ir-dumper](ir-dumper)
A project to capture infrared remote signals and replay the same signals using NodeMCU, an infrared LED, and an infrared sensor. It can be controlled via HTTP API.

## [amr001](amr001)
A project to remotely control a dot matrix using Arduino Uno, NodeMCU (with dot matrix, infrared LED, DHT11, and buzzer). The dot matrix can be adjusted to display desired shapes through HTTP API, shows the current time and temperature, and includes a controller script to automatically adjust the air conditioner based on the current room temperature.
